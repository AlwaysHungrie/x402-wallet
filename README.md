# x402 Wallet

x402 Wallet allows existing desktop AI clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc. to access x402-enabled API and paid MCP servers natively.

x402 Wallet is an electron app that needs to be running while using your desktop client. It consists of a 
 - Solana wallet which needs to be setup and funded with SOL and USDC. 
 - MCP server that needs to be configured in the desktop client.

Once the x402 wallet is running, you can call any paid api endpoint (such as /seller/api-server) or access paid tools of existing MCP servers (such as /seller/mcp-server) from within the desktop client.
